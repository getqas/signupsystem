It is an amazing signup or register system that I learned and developed as a working project while taking a course on udemy. 
It includes schema for db table and everything to get up and running fast with an amazing form that uses PHP, ajax, jquery and CSS. 
It uses ajax and jquery to validate the forms in realtime. 
The form is thoughtfully styled with CSS so that if you are interested in learning how CSS works and not just plugging in a library or framework you can.
My big addition was to make the radio buttons very friendly. I am super proud of those.
There is also some nice soft transitions to make for a great user experience.
At the end the user gets a nice message indicating that they have been registered into the system.
Big thanks go to the instructor of the course of udemy.
